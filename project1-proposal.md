## Project Proposals

**Local Flora & Fauna**  
Here I am interested in learning about the local ecosystem over time. I will collect any images of plant and animal life I can find and do some more research about the landscape's changes over time.  
Collection(s): 
- Cook County Forest Preserve Photographs (UIC)
- Chicago Aerial Photographic Services collection (UIC)

**Gallery of Familiar Places**  
This would require me to look through image databases and try to locate any locations that are familiar to me. I will probably just search for my town's name and create a mini archive of familiar locations.  
Collection(s): 
- C. William Brubaker Collection (UIC)
- Chicago Aerial Photographic Services collection (UIC)


**Cityscapes**  
This would be similar in nature to the Flora and Fauna proposal except I am looking at architectural changes in urban spaces. I might focus on Lake Shore Drive because I have heard it has changed quite a lot over the years.  
Collection(s): 
- Illinois Department of Transportation Traffic Photograph Collection (UIC)
- Chicago Aerial Photographic Services collection (UIC)
